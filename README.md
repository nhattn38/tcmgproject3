# tcmgproject3
# hello this my assignment for my tcmg-412 project
# this repo contains the python code that I used to solve the problems for the assignment:
    # how many total requests have been made in the last year?
    # how many total requests were made in the time period represented by the log?
# I wasn't sure if the http_access_log.txt file was supposed to be included in the repo
# the txt file should download when the code is ran which is why I have it because I pushed the contents of my local onto an empty repo
